[radio host]<i> News conference

00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,737

<i>of possible Earth-like planets,</i>

12
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,382

14
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,905
<i>All aboard the QE2.</i>

<i>Not really, you don't
want to board this thing.</i>

it'll be no closer than</i>

<i>3.6 million miles.</i> [laughing]

20
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>But still, as far as
a big asteroid's concerned,</i>

21
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,444

22
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,231
<i>They say it's not
going to hit us,</i>

23
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,835

and I hope they're right.</i>

24
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,770

25
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,307

39
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,719
He was on last week talking
about farmers on Mars.

40
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,459
I tell you, Roy,

41
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,860
it's really great to
have you coming back out.

42
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,915
What's it been,
two months, three months?

43
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,016
Four.

44
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,435
Well...

45
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,571
well, it's great.

46
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,773
It's not been the same.

[shaking]

48
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,387
So, anyway, um...

49
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,591
finally got a camera
hooked up to the telescope.

50
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,245
You wouldn't believe the detail I'm
getting with these clear skies.

51
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,649
I'm telling you, Roy,
once it's fully kitted out,

52
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,666
I will be giving NASA
a run for their money.

53
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,322
Once again, Harry, your humility
is an example to us all.

54
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:10,908
[laughs]
Honestly, Roy, she's a beauty.

55
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,079
You've named it, haven't you?

56
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,899
Yeah, well, she's special.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,016
Of course.

58
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,488
So, what you going
to do this evening?

59
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,893
I don't know.

60
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,677
Harry?

61
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,644
[laughs] Sorry.

62
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,127
I mean, I can
just fold it up, actually.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,850
Yeah.

64
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,565
Astraeus?

65
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,872
Mike?

66
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Yeah.

67
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,610
He works with you?

68
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,115
Yeah.

69
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,454
He's been coming out
the last couple of weeks

70
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,386
trialing some new tech
he's developing.

71
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,939
[vehicle bumping]

72
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,156
Could be some pretty
game-changing stuff apparently.

73
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,925
- According to who?
- Well...

74
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,696
According to Mike. [chuckles]

75
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,884
Seriously, he's not out
here having fun like us,

76
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,615
he's actually got
a lot riding on it.

77
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,505
But to be honest,
it's all a bit above my head.

78
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,125
Another classic astronomy pun.

79
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,761
Like space,

80
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,413
which is also above my head.

81
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,933
I get it.

82
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,418
I thought it was funny.

83
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,709
Since you haven't
been here for a while,

84
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,685
we had to move some
of your stuff in the back.

85
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,995
Mike needed the room.

86
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,865
Yeah, I noticed.

87
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,137
You guys good friends?

88
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:22,841
Why?

89
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,209
Just wondering.

90
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,997
Is that okay with you?

91
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:30,214
Why wouldn't it be?

92
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,737
I can think of a few reasons.

93
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,822
[gentle music]

94
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,834
You got yours?

95
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,603
You going to wear it?

96
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,574
Nah.

00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,600
Looks heavy.

100
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:46,701
Yeah, it is.

101
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,287
Actually, could you just
give me a hand here?

102
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,058
I'm busy.

103
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,094
Doing what?

104
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,282
Listen, while you were
snoring your head back there,

105
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,783
I was watching the road.

106
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,318
You mean you actually meant
to hit all those potholes?

107
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,970
- What was that?
- Huh?

108
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,124
Make sure you don't
drop that thing, okay?

109
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,224
Yep.

110
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,832
- You comfortable there, Roy?
- Oh, he's busy.

111
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,985
Just helping Mike get all your
junk out of my new office.

112
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm surprised you guys don't have
this down to a fine art yet.

113
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,057
Just shut up and drink
your damn tea, okay?

114
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,761
Well, here she is.

115
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,648
Roy, this is Annabelle.

116
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,032
Annabelle, Roy.

117
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,851
Oh, my God. Does your
wife know about this?

118
00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:38,354
[Harry] Does she know
about what?

119
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,205
That you've named
this thing after her.

120
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,625
No, no. Not yet, no,

121
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,743
but I think it's kind
of romantic, you know?

122
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,749
After all, this thing's
beautiful, slender,

123
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,817
makes life worth living.

124
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,304
It's also stiff, and emotionless

125
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,706
and weighs a ton,

126
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,825
but I'm sure she'll
appreciate the sentiment.

127
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,094
Yeah.

128
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,947
Just gimme a hand
with it, will you?

129
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,264
I've already asked him.

130
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,749
[gentle music]

131
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,118

[mechanical noises]

135
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,493
Take it easy on the guy, okay?

136
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,147
I haven't said anything, have I?

137
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:12,445
I never say you said anything.

138
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,082
I'm saying give him a chance.

139
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,283
He's a decent bloke.

140
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,736
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
- No, I mean it, Roy.

141
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,773
I don't want any of
your funny business.

142
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,741
Harry, I said,
don't worry about it.

143
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,432
I was thinking tonight might
be my last night anyway.

144
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,916
[solemn music]

145
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,355

[mechanical whirring]

147
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,971
- [Mike] All set?
- Yeah, yeah.

148
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,701
Could you pass me
that cable, Harry?

149
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,975
- This one here?
- Yeah.

150
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,192
- You got it?
- Yeah, thanks.

151
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,428
Excuse me.

152
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,620
Harry, if you route anymore
goddamn cables through there,

153
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,758
- there's going to be no room for me.
- Calm down,

154
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:29,975
this is the only one I need.

155
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,914
Well, then what are
the rest of these for?

156
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,801
Can I rig this through here?

157
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,918
[Harry] Yeah, I'm sure
Roy won't mind.

158
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,389
Bring on the wireless
revolution, I say.

159
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,861
Actually, Roy, could you just
pass me that other blue cable?

160
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:53,966
Roy?

161
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,868
It's just on the floor, yeah.

162
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,206
Too many wires for my liking,
but what can you do, eh?

163
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,043
Here.

164
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,296
Cheers.

165
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,013
Come on, last one, in you go.

166
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,073
I tell you, whoever figures
out how to run this stuff

167
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,971
without cables will be
a bloody millionaire.

168
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,511
You know, it's actually
quite cramped in there, Roy.

169
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,596
I don't know how you're going to
fit in there with all them cables.

170
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,354
[Mike] Okay, think we're pretty much
rigged.
Should be good to go.

171
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,523
[Harry] Great.

172
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,259
[Mike] What are your
plans tonight then?

173
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,116
[Harry] More testing
on the scope's camera,

174
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,995
thankfully the skies
are clear tonight.

175
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,998
[Mike] Chilly though,
it's always a trade-off really.

176
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,482
[gentle music]

177
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,346
[Mike] Yeah, actually,
I just need one more cable.

178
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,481
[Harry] Which cable
is it you want?

179
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:04,269
[Mike] That's the blue one
there, yeah, that's the one.

180
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,783
- [clunking]
- What the hell is going on?

181
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:09,024
[Mike] Yeah, okay, great.

182
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,995
- [rubbing against glass]
- [Mike laughing]

183
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,446
[knocking]

184
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,957
- [Mike] Roy looks happy in there.
- [Harry] Yeah.

185
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,654
[sighs] This is going
to be a long night.

186
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,057
[machine whirring]

187
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,107
[typing on keyboard]

188
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,465
[Harry sighs]

189
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,133
[door closes]

190
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,001
Bloody cold, actually.

191
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,340
I guess the summer's over then?

192
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,171
Yeah, all two weeks of it.

193
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,623
[chuckles] Yeah, nothing
like a British summer.

194
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,201
[groans]

195
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,568
What is...

196
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,557
It's for the scope.

197
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,341
Sometimes branches
get in the way.

198
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,101
- Harry?
- Yep.

199
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,486
- What the hell is this?
- Uh, well, that is a claw.

200
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,559
I can see it's a claw.
What's it doing in the car?

201
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,710
Well, it's for, you know,
clawing things.

202
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,727
Doesn't matter,
just give it here, thank you.

203
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,563
It's for clawing things,
of course, how stupid of me.

204
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,566
No wonder there's no room.

205
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,138
Right then, boys.
Let's get to work.

206
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,543
Mint?

207
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,114
Not for me.

208
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:57,783
Go on.

209
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,785
No.

210
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,102
Thank you.

211
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,288
Harry, mint?

212
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,192
Yeah, go on then. Thank you.

213
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,615
[machines whirring]

214
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,767
[electronic beeps]

215
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,144
[static crackling]

216
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,594
[upbeat swing music]

217
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,635
[solemn music]

218
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,490
[static crackling]

219
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,442
[beat pulsating]

220
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,961
[tense rhythmic music]

221
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,641
1420.

222
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,003
[static crackling]

223
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,375
Can I have a cuppa, Roy?

224
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,410
Oh, sorry. That was my last one.

225
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,479
If I'd have known.

226
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:23,598
Oh, well.

227
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,981
No worries.

228
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,810
Have I said something wrong?

229
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,079
Why?

230
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,567
Just Roy seems
a bit off with me.

231
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,503
[chuckles] No, he's off
with everyone lately.

232
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,053
He's just complicated like that.

233
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,375
I'll move my stuff in the boot,
give him his old spot back.

234
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:08,477
Mike, trust me.
It's nothing you've done.

235
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,826
He'll come around.

236
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,422
So, how's all this
coming along then?

237
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:19,104
Uh...

238
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,557
well, slow. [chuckles]

239
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,759
Slow. Yeah,
that sounds about right.

240
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:25,859
Yeah, quite.

241
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:28,630
They said if I can't
get a working prototype

242
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,047
by the end of the month,
they're going to cut my funding,

243
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,146
which is...

244
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,617
not good, really.

245
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,532
The tweaks we made last
week are looking good,

246
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:39,723
so I'm hopeful for tonight.

247
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,522
Well, I was telling Roy about it
on the way over, actually.

248
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,994
He seemed pretty interested.

249
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,998
Maybe you should run it by him,
see what he makes of it.

250
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,934
Yeah.

251
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,343
- Yeah, I will do.
- He'd like that.

252
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,138
He's a bit of a socially
awkward person really.

253
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,008
Yeah.

254
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:58,971
I know what you mean. [chuckles]

255
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:03,949
So...

256
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,384
How'd you get
into all this, anyway?

257
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:09,855
Well,

258
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,521
my dad's to blame for that one.

259
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,723
Which is always the way, right?

260
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,778
Took me to see
the Perseid meteor shower

261
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,061
when I was about seven.

262
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,016
And that was that.

263
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,115
[soft music]

264
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,634
I never looked back.

265
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,588
I remember him telling me that
everything down here on Earth,

266
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,039
everything we are,
everything we're made of,

267
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,041
comes from up there.

268
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,563
[Mike chuckles]

269
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,467
20 plus years later,
I'm a doctor of astrophysics,

270
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,902
and I'm getting paid
to study distant stars.

271
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,685
It's all a bit crazy, really.

272
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,905
And here we are. [chuckles]

273
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,006
And here we are.

274
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,926
Want to listen
to some more SpaceGab?

275
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,029
Yeah.

276
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,057
[radio host] <i>As I've been
reporting and gabbing about</i>

277
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:59,554
<i>on SpaceGab two podcasts ago,</i>

278
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:03,791
<i>they're looking for Martian
farmers.</i> [radio host laughing]

279
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,595
<i>Not really, not looking
for Martian farmers up there.</i>

280
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,997
[laughs]<i> It's a big thing
growing food up there</i>

281
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:13,134
<i>because you could only eat
so many tubes of steak</i>

282
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,853
<i>or whatever else they're going
to bring up there with them...</i>

283
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,898
Roy?

284
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,785
Hi, Roy.

285
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:31,721
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

286
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:32,822
I'm Mike.

287
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,198
Harry's told me a lot about
you over the last few weeks,

288
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:36,740
and it's great
to finally meet you.

289
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,242
It sounds like
you two go way back.

290
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
Yeah.

291
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,034
Anyway, he was telling
me you were interested

292
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,617
in the project I'm working on.

293
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,922
Right.

294
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,474
Still trying to
debug the system,

295
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,993
making a few tweaks,
but it should work now.

296
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,566
So, I listen to space.

297
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,669
That's what I do.

298
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,837
Nothing new, but still
pretty incredible, eh?

299
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,773
Do you know much
about radio astronomy?

300
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,094
Not a lot.

301
00:25:13,193 --> 00:25:17,031
That's cool.
Basically, I study distant
objects in space

302
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,866
through their radio frequencies,

303
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,484
and there's
a lot of things up there:

304
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,637
stars, Pulsars, Quasars,

305
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,173
and they all emit radio waves,

306
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:27,241
and these waves travel
through space like light,

307
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:32,563
and we can listen in using
radio equipment, like this.

308
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,633
- [static crackling]
- [gentle music]

309
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,721
But if we use radio telescopes,

310
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,655
we can take it a step further,

311
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:46,595
capturing all this incoming
data and convert it into images.

312
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,811
Learn more about the Universe
that we live in.

313
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,866
Obviously,
we can't see radio waves,

314
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,152
but if we could see radio waves,
then this is what we'd see,

315
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,875
that's Saturn, this is the Moon,

316
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,693
and these are
a couple of galaxies.

317
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,682
Check this out, if we collect
all of this incoming data,

318
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:10,000
then you can build
a picture of what space...

319
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,304
sounds like.

320
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:19,943
Beautiful, isn't it?

321
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,083
I'm hoping to make
my own with this program.

322
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,671
Anyway, the super cool
thing about radio astronomy

323
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,740
is that you can see the universe

324
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,324
in a completely different way.

325
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,354
You know, get her to give up
more of her secrets. [laughs]

326
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,080
Now, but the problem
with all this incoming data

327
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,616
is that it usually takes weeks,
months to process,

328
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:47,788
but I think I've found a way to see
what we're getting as we're getting it,

329
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:50,558
effectively a real-time
visual render program,

330
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,769
which will seriously speed up
the whole process.

331
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:54,846
In theory.

332
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,217
In theory, yeah.

333
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:01,232
Unfortunately, that's
what most of my investors

334
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,490
are beginning to think it is,

335
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,590
but I it will work.

336
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,173
I just need more time.

337
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:08,143
Obviously, it's tough for him,

338
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:10,845
his antenna's nothing
compared to the big ones.

339
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:11,944
Yeah.

340
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,519
But it'll give me enough
to prove the system works.

341
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,003
Anyway, let me show you.

342
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,678
[tense music]

343
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,986
Wait, that's not right at all.

344
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,968
Well, what's that, what the
hell is that supposed to be?

345
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:42,865
- Is it the Moon again?
- It's not the Moon.

346
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,832
[sighs] It's another glitch.

347
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,055
I'm sorry, Roy.
I thought I was close

348
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:55,338
but it's still not working.

349
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,740
[solemn music]

350
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,811
I wish I could show you.

351
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,939
Stick with it, Mike.

352
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,123
You'll crack it
eventually, I know it.

353
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,822
[tense music]

354
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,159
[static crackling]

355
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,917
[garbled speech]

356
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,954
[suspenseful music]

357
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,993
[light rhythmic thumping]

358
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,519
1420.

359
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,825
[static crackling]

360
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,933
[static crackling]

361
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,214
[machine beeping]

362
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,945
- Harry?
- Mm-hmm?

363
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,648
Harry?

364
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,049
Listen to this.

365
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,359
What?

366
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:38,006
- What? what do you mean, "What"?
- What am I listening to?

367
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,105
Well, the blips.

368
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,300
I don't hear no blips, Mike.

369
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,971
Did you record it?

370
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,106
No, I was asleep.

371
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,997
- It's 1420.
- Oh, no.

372
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:58,199
Not little green men again,
is it, Mike?

373
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:01,134
- You going to send these lot a message
as well?
- Look, don't start.

374
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:03,829
Have the others replied yet, by the way?
It's just I've only got

375
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,273
22,000 years
to get the house straight.

376
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,690
Did you ask them if they liked
lemon sponge or fruitcake?

377
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,467
It's just I want
to be ready, that's all.

378
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,145
Harry, it's 1420.

379
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:14,048
I just don't like
unexpected visitors, Mike,

380
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,506
especially the little
green kind.

381
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:17,085
1420, that's the water hole.

382
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:18,462
Well, the water hole's dried up.

383
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:22,056
Maybe it's those farmers on Mars
complaining about lack of rain.

384
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:25,159
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- This is your
long-range weather forecast

385
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,928
for all you
crop-growers out there.

386
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,396
It looks like a cool
minus 55 outside

387
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:32,200
and this dusty, dry spell
sweeping in from the east

388
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,019
is here to stay for
the next million years. [laughs]

389
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,781
It wasn't funny
last week, Harry.

390
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,413
- I bet it was a Pulsar.
- Pulsar? - Yep.

391
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:48,016
- No.
- I know what a bloody Pulsar
sounds like, Mike.

392
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:51,152
I might not listen to them for a living,
but they're very much in my field.

393
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:54,488
- I'm sure you do, Harry, but you didn't
hear this, did you?
- Did you hear it?

394
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:56,464
But it wasn't a Pulsar,
not with this antenna.

395
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:59,040
Well, it's not little green men
if that's what you're saying?

396
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:01,458
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what are you saying?

397
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:02,756
- Well...
- Look, a Pulsar...

398
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,855
It wasn't a Pulsar.

399
00:33:03,954 --> 00:33:05,432
I know Pulsars, all right?

400
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:08,617
I listen to them day in,
day out. It wasn't a Pulsar.

401
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,376
Look, I wouldn't worry about it, Mike,
everyone's listening to the water hole.

402
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:14,154
If you've heard it,
they've heard it too.

403
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:16,492
So, you've all been listening
to Pulsars together.

404
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,517
Right, I'm going
to re-calibrate the scope.

405
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:23,700
I'll be back in a bit.

406
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,223
Remember,
lemon cake or fruitcake?

407
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:33,160
I know which one you are,
I just want to
know which ones they prefer,

408
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,538
but I think I know that already.

409
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,637
Get the hell out of here.

410
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:36,737
Pulsar.

411
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,348
Look, it wasn't a Pulsar.

412
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,355
[static crackling]

413
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,727
[tense music]

414
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Roy?

415
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,527
Roy?

416
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,764
Roy?

417
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,668
[soft tense music]

418
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,213
Oh.

419
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,655
[radio host]<i> Okay,
you're listening to DJ Jimmy</i>

420
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>playing all
the classic club bangers!</i>

421
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:45,342
<i>101.4 throughout the night...</i>

422
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,528
[Roy snoring]

423
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:49,746
[Mike sighs]

424
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,789
[gentle music]

425
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,501
Greetings on behalf of
the people of my world.

426
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,538
This is Mike Webster...

427
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,907
of Planet Earth.

428
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,608
We are here.

429
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,579
We are not afraid.

430
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,300
If you are out there
and you are listening,

431
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,802
this is a routine response

432
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,452
to an acquired signal at...

433
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,454
01:33 GMT,

434
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,759
16.10.16.

435
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,862
Unidentified source.

436
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,333
Your signal made it.

437
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,902
We are listening.

438
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,724
Oh, and if this is
the local police station,

439
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:52,936
I'm sorry if I'm interfering
with your gear again.

440
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,215
But perhaps you should have invested
in some better radio equipment.

441
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,251
[tense music]

442
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,009
So.

443
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,675
[Mike sighs]

444
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,478
Speak English, do they?

445
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,266
You heard that, then?

446
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:34,197
Probably the only person
who ever will.

447
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,771
Harry's certainly got
some interesting friends.

448
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,255
Oh, please, don't tell him.

449
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,206
Don't worry, I wouldn't dare
repeat some of the weirdness

450
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:44,427
I've heard in the company
of scientists.

451
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,534
So, should I set a place
at the table for the Pulsar?

452
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,472
Like I said.

453
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,358
Picked up some pretty interesting
things last week, didn't you Mike?

454
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,655
Thought you'd made contact
with some intelligent life.

455
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:01,954
Yeah, not so intelligent life.

456
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,798
No, turned out to be two
traffic cops off the A38.

457
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,382
[Roy laughing]

458
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,003
- [Roy] Brilliant.
- It really was.

459
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,005
Played havoc
with their radio systems.

460
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,702
They thought it was
some sort of threat

461
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,442
from the local crime ring.

462
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,411
- Within minutes, choppers were all over
us.
- Yeah, all right.

463
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,266
- Still didn't catch you though, did
they, Mike?
- Okay, very good.

464
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,204
- [Roy laughs]
- He's a wanted man, you know.

465
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:23,304
[Mike chuckles]

466
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,802
[Harry laughing]

467
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,748
Harry, can I use
your scope on this pass?

468
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,784
Yeah, just give us a sec.

469
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,757
It's coming over in about two.

470
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,512
Uh, okay, do you want
to boot it up at your station

471
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,713
- or do you want to use mine?
- No, I'll stay here.

472
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:56,317
Right, just type in
your elevation

473
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,773
and bearings like before,
and the scope should auto-track.

474
00:38:58,873 --> 00:38:59,873
Okay.

475
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,356
- [scope whirring]
- [gentle music]

476
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,780
[machine beeping]

477
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,532
What just happened?

478
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,036
- What's that?
- I, I don't know, I've just lost it.

479
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,641
- What?
- Goodman, it's just gone.

480
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,065
- [sighs] I don't understand what you
mean, Roy.
- The Goodman, it's
disappeared.

481
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,121
- All right, calm down.
- Well, I'm
looking at it, Harry, and it's gone.

482
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,467
[tense music]

483
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:55,846
What are you talking about, Roy?

484
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:56,952
It's right there.

485
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,719
- [Roy] I'm telling you, Harry.
- Satellites don't just vanish, Roy.

486
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,494
- I know what I saw, it just went blank
on me.
- All right, guys.

487
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:11,594
Chill out.

488
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,603
It's just a satellite.

489
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:15,905
Just a satellite?

490
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,875
Yeah, what's the big deal?

491
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,545
Who the hell
do you think you are?

492
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,047
You have no idea,

493
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,148
no idea what's
going here, do you?

494
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:28,818
- He doesn't know.
- Well, he should.

495
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,889
He took my job.

496
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,838
For Christ's sake, Roy.
Give him a break.

497
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:39,414
You know what?
I've just about had
enough of this lecturing.

498
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:41,072
And what's that
supposed to mean, Roy?

499
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:42,369
It means what it means, Harry.

500
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,568
[door slams]

501
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,891
[Roy sighs]

502
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,909
Mike, I am so sorry about that.

503
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,652
[Mike] What did Roy mean,
I took his job?

504
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,123
There's something
you need to know about Roy.

505
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,978
Goodman,
that satellite up there,

506
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,563
that's his, or as good as his.

507
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,902
Do you remember ENSAT Aerospace?

508
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:21,521
Yeah, sure, yeah.

509
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,490
Well, Roy used to work for them

510
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,893
as their lead aviation engineer,

511
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,628
helped develop navigation
systems for the military,

512
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:30,880
you know, fighter jets,
that sort of thing.

513
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,851
I really looked up
to him, I still do.

514
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,925
But don't tell him I said that.

515
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,172
[Mike chuckles]

516
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:40,690
[solemn music]

517
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,079
A couple of years ago
ENSAT won a contract

518
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:48,548
to manufacture
a research satellite,

519
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,800
and Roy was selected
to head up the project.

520
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,268
I was assigned to help them
develop some of their

521
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,871
instrumentation
for the satellite.

522
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,009
That's how I met Roy.

523
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,278
He's a bloody
good engineer, you know?

524
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,679
Took the project well
beyond my expectations

525
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,650
for the science
we could achieve.

526
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:14,992
Anyway...

527
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,960
about a year ago,

528
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,081
three or so months
before delivery,

529
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,733
Astraeus, the company you work for,
came along and acquired ENSAT.

530
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,005
And they fired him.

531
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,860
They fired him and all his team,

532
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,344
straight out, non-negotiable.

533
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,070
Astraeus wanted the prestige of
delivering the satellite themselves,

534
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,445
so they got their own guys
to come in and finish it off.

535
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,688
I mean, we'd done 99%
of the work, of course, but...

536
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,358
that wasn't the point.

537
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,364
It hit him hard.

538
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,967
Three years he gave to Goodman.

539
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,204
He brought it to life,
he taught it to think,

540
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,273
and he wasn't even
invited to see it launch.

541
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,766
When you dedicate so much
of your life to something,

542
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:13,949
it becomes a part of you.

543
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,221
And Astraeus took it away
from him like it was nothing.

544
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,427
Harry, I had no idea.

545
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,230
Well, why would you?

546
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,766
But Roy just
sees you as Astraeus.

547
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,152
And although that doesn't
excuse what just happened,

548
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:35,532
it does explain why it happened.

549
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:40,943
I'm sorry.

550
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,280
It's my fault,
I should have explained it.

551
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,972
Being on the research team,
I didn't work for ENSAT,

552
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,891
so I stayed on and that
obviously complicated things.

553
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,827
I thought he'd be
over it by now, but...

554
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,478
This was our little group.

555
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,246

556
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,951
Just me, Roy and another.

557
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,239
We all worked on the project,
dumb really,

558
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,498
but it was just a bit of fun.

559
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,210
Roy and I used to come out here

560
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,929
and imagine
seeing our satellite.

561
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,286
It was supposed to be this
great moment, you know?

562
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,969
We built that and it's in space.

563
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,043
But now Roy, just looks up and
he sees everything he's lost.

564
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,005
I thought you'd had
your last cup?

565
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,559
This is my last cup.

566

[tense music]

696
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:56,878
Mike, what was your cycle rate?

697
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,134
- Cycle rate?
- Yeah, how many cycles
did you transmit?

698
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:04,085
- [Mike] Why?
- Because we're hearing
this thing loop over and over.

699
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,704
I dunno, a half a dozen or so.
Look, it was just a bit of fun.

700
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:10,240
Yeah, but have we not heard it
more times than that already?

701
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,079
- Yeah, definitely.
- Then it can't be a straight bounce.

702
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:16,813
- That's what I've been saying.
- No,
no, no, what you're saying is it can't
be a bounce

703
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,233
as there's nothing at that
range to bounce back off from.

704
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,521
What I'm saying is,
how can this be a bounce

705
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:22,956
if it's now looping more times

706
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:24,907
than the original
cycles you transmitted?

707
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:27,009
Am I right?

708
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,164
I'm right, right?

709
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,867
[dramatic music]

710
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,918
Are you sure
you're rolling on this?

711
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,853
- Yeah, hundred percent.
- Holy Christ.

712
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:42,074
We need confirmation
on this, Mike, rapid.

713
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:43,175
Call it in.

714
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:46,061
I'll check to see if there's
any chatter over at SETI.

- Get up!<i>
- I've got to be up at four
o'clock in the bloody morning.</i>

736
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,032
Dave, we've got
a target signal here.

737
00:58:41,132 --> 00:58:42,135
<i>What? Where are you?</i>

738
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:44,592
What do you mean where am I?
It doesn't matter where I am.

739
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,849
Can you just get up, we need
an affirm on this, ASAP.

740
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:49,306
<i>Okay, okay, give me a minute,
I'll go to the control room.</i>

741
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,547
- Any talk on the servers?
- No, I guess
everyone's just working the signal.

742
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:55,804
We must have caught it early.

<i>Yeah, you got

<i>- Go ahead.</i>

- Read back?
<i>- 1420.163.</i>

00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:11,130
Yeah, good read-back.
Run the numbers.

<i>The Waterhole?
Mike, we're listening</i>

751
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,568
<i>- to that frequency 24/7.</i>
- Dave, run the numbers,

752
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:16,952
I'm telling you, you'll hear it.

753
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,594
<i>Okay, hang on a minute,
we'll have a listen.</i>

754
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,735
We've got a lot of
surface clutter, Dave.

755
00:59:21,835 --> 00:59:23,313
See if you can
clean it up your end.

756
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:24,413
<i>Will do.</i>

757
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,695
Mike, what is the Waterhole?

758
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,083
The electromagnetic spectrum

759
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:32,702
is just cluttered
with garble, right?

760
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,759
Trying to spot an intelligent
signal within that

761
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:37,054
is like trying to have a
conversation at rock concert,

762
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:38,974
you just can't do it,
but at 1420 megahertz,

763
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,927
there's a natural dead spot.

764
00:59:43,027 --> 00:59:45,264
It's like a quiet tunnel
cutting through all the noise.

765
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:46,844
- And that's the Waterhole?
- Right.

766
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,414
If you want to send
a signal out into space,

767
00:59:49,514 --> 00:59:50,793
the Waterhole's your best chance

768
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:51,893
of getting it heard.

769
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:56,793
Dave?

770
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,628
How's it looking there, mate?

771
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,097
<i>Uh...</i>

772
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:05,333
<i>Standby. We're not
hearing anything yet.</i>

773
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,313
Like I said, there's a lot of
clutter, but the transmission's

774
01:00:08,413 --> 01:00:10,130
pretty damn obvious,
you know what I mean?

775
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,157
<i>Yeah, we're still getting
zip here, Mike.</i>

776
01:00:12,257 --> 01:00:14,454
Well, I don't understand
how that can be, we've got it

777
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:15,554
loud and clear here.

778
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,052
<i>Negative,
I'm just hearing static.</i>

779
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:18,869
- Well, then, scan the band.
<i>- Look, Mike,</i>

780
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:20,327
<i>I've checked
and there's nothing.</i>

781
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:21,750
<i>Your gear's faulty.</i>

782
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:23,318
No.

783
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,320

784
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:30,009

[solemn music]

786
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,847
We've got a voice.

787
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:38,634
<i>Say again, Mike, sounded
like you said, "A voice".</i>

788
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,003
That's affirm, Dave.

789
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,972
We're getting a voice.

790
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,795

anything on this band?

01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,152
So, what just happened?

806
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,322
I don't understand how
they're not reading this.

807
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,728
They've got an array
of 50-meter dishes.

808

All we've got is
this piddly little thing.

809
01:01:38,646 --> 01:01:39,684
It doesn't make any sense.

810
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,414
There's absolutely
no talk of this online?

811
01:01:42,514 --> 01:01:44,554
Zilch. I mean, are we
the only one's getting this?

812
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:47,353
I can't understand how
that could be the case.

813
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:48,903
I don't see how that's possible.

814
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,472
I know.

815
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,751
The whole world's listening
to this frequency.

It's almost a cliché that
somethings coming through on it.

817
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,579
But there is something
coming through?

818
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,099
Yeah, look, I scroll away...

I roll back to 1420

822
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:09,858
and there it is, plain as day.

823
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:13,461
There's no two ways about it,
this is an incoming signal.

824
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,684
Look, forgive my ignorance here,
but before we get ahead of ourselves,

825
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:20,969
can you just explain to me
how this, your message,

826
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,005
is the same as a signal
from outer space?

827
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:26,693
- It could be a leader signal.
- Like a beacon.

828
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:27,793
Right, like a beacon.

829
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,929
Something we'd recognize
that we could latch onto.

830
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:31,931
Once we hook on,
there could be more.

831
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:35,168
Yeah, but isn't all this just
a little too specific to us?

832
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:37,869
I mean, it's almost too good
to be true, not to mention fast.

833

You only sent the damn
thing a few hours ago.

There's a hell of a lot going
on here that I can't explain.

01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,197

You can't argue with this.

If we are the only ones
getting this...

841
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:05,480
and we sit on it, or worse, just
let it slip through the net.

842
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:09,920
I'd rather be wrong
and have done the right thing.

843
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:12,521
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
So what?

But if we're right about this...

845
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:22,864

I think is happening here...

Mike, we're on station

01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:31,148

863
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,990
I've re-routed all the power
from the main battery,

864
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,094
that should give us enough,
but can I
shut down Roy's system to be sure?

865

866
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:46,264

Yeah, right-o.

869
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,657
Copy. Waiting on you.

870
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:03,597
Okay, guys, separate
the antennas and spread out.

873
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:10,056
With my primary antenna
on the car,

874
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:12,190
and your two hand-helds
we can establish

875
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,594

Nothing.

1048
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,904
I figure there's two
types of scientists, Mike.

1049
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,775

what's going on here.

the answers out there.

to push the boundaries

But if we're the only people
receiving this signal,

1068

then we're the only people that
can make sure the world hears it.

1069

really is first contact

extraterrestrial race,

1212
01:29:24,742 --> 01:29:27,139
Look, I dunno what it means,
but we can't rule anything out

1213
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:28,796
as coincidence.
When's she due to pass

1214
01:29:28,895 --> 01:29:30,134
- over again?
- Eight minutes.

1215
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:31,582
Okay. Well, let's get on it.

1216
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:34,277
There's something going on here
guys I reckon we've got the jump

1217
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:36,253
on everyone else.
Harry, go fire up the scope.

1218
01:29:36,354 --> 01:29:37,988
Absolutely. That's more like it.

1219
01:29:38,088 --> 01:29:40,525
[Mike] Yep, we're going to have
to speak to you later, Dave.

1220
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:41,823
- [Dave]<i> Yeah, great.</i>
- Yeah.

1221
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:43,394
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>
- Yeah.

1222
01:29:43,493 --> 01:29:45,005
- [phone beeping]
- [tense music]

1223
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,015
Mike?

1224
01:29:49,618 --> 01:29:51,118
[uplifting music]

1225
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:21,948
Now, we're talking.

1226
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,470
Right, chief. Let's do this.

1227
01:30:25,569 --> 01:30:27,087
[dramatic music]

1228
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,492
[clock ticking]

1229
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,162
- One minute!
- One minute!

1230
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,814
[Roy] Come on, load
the last recording.

1231
01:30:37,914 --> 01:30:39,632
[Mike] Okay,
I've got it, here it is.

1232
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,524
I need some numbers, Roy.

1233
01:30:46,623 --> 01:30:47,792
I know, I know.

1234
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:49,131
Come on, come on, fast forward.

1235
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:51,878
There.

1236
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:55,615
I told you.

1237
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,113
Numbers?

1238
01:31:10,213 --> 01:31:11,815
We've got 30 seconds, guys.

1239
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:13,934
Elevation, 18 degrees,
south by south-east.

1240
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:17,121
18 degrees, south, southeast?

1241
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,890
Bearing, one-five-niner.

1242
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,557
One-five-niner.

1243
01:31:20,658 --> 01:31:21,908
20 seconds!

1244
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,698
Scope set, we're rolling.

1245
01:31:27,797 --> 01:31:29,149
Ten seconds, here she comes.

1246
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:31,717
Keep your eyes peeled, boys.

1247
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:34,921
Five,

1248
01:31:35,171 --> 01:31:36,171
four,

1249
01:31:36,306 --> 01:31:37,506
three,

1250
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:38,807
two,

1251
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,560
one.

1252
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,153
Got it.

1253
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:50,252
Tracking.

1254
01:31:53,742 --> 01:31:55,074
[dramatic music intensifies]

1255
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,212
[soft tense music]

1256
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:29,743
Hold that position.

1257
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,149
I told you.

1258
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,283
What did I tell you, huh?

1259
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,119
What in God's name
is going on here?

1260
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,192
Sky map.

1261
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,762
Mike, your sky map.

1262
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:52,666
Sky map?

1263
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:58,088
No, the image from
your system earlier.

1264
01:32:58,189 --> 01:33:00,273
It's gone,
his hard-drive's fried.

1265
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:03,072
- Damn it.
- Well, look, I lost the one
from earlier,

1266
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:04,930
- but I can run the program again.
- Do it.

1267
01:33:05,029 --> 01:33:07,827
- Do you remember it doesn't work
properly, right?
- Do it.

1268
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:10,717
Okay.

1269
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,653
[machine whirring]

1270
01:33:16,358 --> 01:33:18,242
[Roy] There.

1271
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,341
That.

1272
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,894
Yeah, what about it?

1273
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,390
What if this is
no system glitch?

1274
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,734
What if your program
works perfectly?

1275
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:29,868
And this...

1276
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,137
this is no error.

1277
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:37,844
What if this,
whatever this is...

1278
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,180
is what's blocking
the satellites?

1279
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,501
You said yourself your program
is looking straight up

1280
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:51,341
and that should not be there.

1281
01:33:51,442 --> 01:33:53,792
[dramatic music]

1282
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,997
Harry, has your
scope got infrared?

1283
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:00,935
Yeah.

1284
01:34:01,418 --> 01:34:02,836
Yeah, it does.

1285
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:18,418
That's not right.

1286
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:22,206
Space should read
as dark red in IR mode.

1287
01:34:22,305 --> 01:34:23,823
Black is wrong.

1288
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:26,693
There's nothing there,
there's not even stars.

1289
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:29,846
Wait, Harry, stop.

1290
01:34:29,947 --> 01:34:31,264
[soft tense music]

1291
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,301
Pan right.

1292
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:46,046
Stop.

1293
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,449
Stars.

1294
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,704
Zoom out.

1295
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,408
Keep coming.

1296
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:24,016
There's something up there.

1297
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:26,051
Oh, my God.

1298
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:52,945
[dramatic music]

1299
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:00,953
I don't believe it.

1300
01:36:02,524 --> 01:36:04,323
I do not believe it.

1301
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:24,042
It's been there all night.

1302
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:27,012
Right above us.

1303
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,884
You are recording this right?

1304
01:36:40,162 --> 01:36:41,162
Roy?

1305
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,296
Roy, get a load of this.

1306
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:50,502
I can't see anything.

1307
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:01,213
Well, it's no wonder.

1308
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:03,833
Whatever it is,
it isn't reading on the scope

1309
01:37:03,934 --> 01:37:06,373
in the visible spectrum, but in
infrared it's crystal clear.

1310
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,421
Yeah, and I'm getting
a strong radio signature.

1311
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:11,925
Christ.

1312
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:13,560
Do we report this?

1313
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,945
I wouldn't know what to report.

1314
01:37:16,046 --> 01:37:20,050
Well, surely, if it's visible
through
infrared, NASA's got to be
picking it up.

1315
01:37:20,149 --> 01:37:21,551
Probably.

1316
01:37:21,652 --> 01:37:23,409
To be honest,
anyone with an infrared scope

1317
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,421
would be able to see this,
but you know,

1318
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:27,472
it's not exactly drawing
attention to itself.

1319
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:30,527
It's got to be a couple
of hundred meters wide,

1320
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:32,505
probably about the size
of a football stadium,

1321
01:37:33,148 --> 01:37:35,047
and although, yeah,
that's pretty big,

1322
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,623
compared to the rest
of the sky it's pretty small.

1323
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:41,404
Unless you were combing
systematically across the whole sky,

1324
01:37:41,505 --> 01:37:43,176
you'd easily miss it,
look, watch.

1325
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:53,565
It's basically
a shadow in space.

1326
01:37:54,603 --> 01:37:57,036
Pretty hard to see
shadows in the dark.

1327
01:38:03,912 --> 01:38:05,912
I never would've believed it.

1328
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:11,516
[machine beeping]

1329
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,230
What the hell?

1330
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:30,069
What is that?

1331
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:39,045
I mean, that's sound.

1332
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:41,768
It's real time imaging,
it works.

1333
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,635
Look, my system works,
it actually works.

1334
01:38:44,734 --> 01:38:47,003
[all laughing]

1335
01:38:47,104 --> 01:38:48,387
[patterned beeping]

1336
01:38:48,957 --> 01:38:49,957
No.

1337
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:02,534
It's the source of the signal.

1338
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,217
Look, it's transmitting,
I mean, these pulses,

1339
01:39:07,318 --> 01:39:09,398
they sync with the clicks
coming through the tuner.

1340
01:39:09,711 --> 01:39:11,307
- It wasn't a bounce back at all.
- No.

1341
01:39:11,408 --> 01:39:13,179
It was being broadcast
from orbit.

1342
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:16,448
Sounds like Morse Code.

1343
01:39:19,587 --> 01:39:20,587
No.

1344
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:23,021
No, it's binary.

1345
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,364
Yeah, it's binary.

1346
01:39:36,671 --> 01:39:37,987
It's got to be a loop pattern.

1347
01:39:38,087 --> 01:39:40,557
- Is it random?
- Non-random, binary is never random.

1348
01:39:42,711 --> 01:39:45,962
- Why are they transmitting binary?
- Out of pure logic.

1349
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:49,033
Maths is the language of the universe,
no translation required.

1350
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:52,202
Yeah, two plus two will always equal
four no matter where you come from.

1351
01:39:52,301 --> 01:39:54,971
If an alien civilization is
intelligent enough to transmit,

1352
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,229
let alone travel through space,
then they need maths.

1353
01:39:57,328 --> 01:39:59,445
Yeah, and if another
civilization is advanced enough

1354
01:39:59,546 --> 01:40:01,159
to intercept this signal, then

1355
01:40:04,265 --> 01:40:05,462
they'll definitely know maths.

1356
01:40:05,563 --> 01:40:07,720
But surely, they're more
advanced than simple binary?

1357
01:40:07,819 --> 01:40:09,777
Substantially, yeah,
but they don't know we are.

1358
01:40:09,877 --> 01:40:11,515
It's the best way
to make first contact.

1359
01:40:11,614 --> 01:40:12,693
And maths is common ground.

1360
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:18,411
You know what else
is binary, don't you?

1361
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,448
- Arecibo.
- Arecibo.

1362
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,203
This is insane.

1363
01:40:26,302 --> 01:40:28,171
Look, tell him about Arecibo.

1364
01:40:28,271 --> 01:40:30,573
Okay, Roy, get this,
in the '70s,

1365
01:40:30,673 --> 01:40:32,643
a binary message was
broadcast into space

1366
01:40:32,743 --> 01:40:35,145
from the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.

1367
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:37,314
1,679 digits, right?

1368
01:40:37,413 --> 01:40:39,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah something like that,
but it was never really

1369
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:41,389
a serious attempt
to make contact.

1370
01:40:41,488 --> 01:40:42,488
No, not really,

1371
01:40:42,587 --> 01:40:43,786
its purpose was to demonstrate

1372
01:40:43,886 --> 01:40:45,046
the telescope's capabilities.

1373
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:47,470
I mean, they were aiming
it at a star system

1374
01:40:47,569 --> 01:40:48,993
that was 25,000
light years away.

1375
01:40:49,092 --> 01:40:50,844
That's 50,000 years
for a reply at best.

1376
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,515
Well, you're going to
run up a hell of a bill

1377
01:40:53,615 --> 01:40:55,240
- being kept on hold that long.
- Yeah.

1378
01:40:56,518 --> 01:40:58,216
It could have been intercepted.

1379
01:41:00,488 --> 01:41:01,587
It's a possibility.

1380
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:05,274
I think everything's just moved

1381
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:07,560
from a possibility
to a probability.

1382
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:24,094
What did you say it was?

1383
01:41:24,194 --> 01:41:25,194
1,600 and?

1384
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:26,292
79.

1385
01:41:26,391 --> 01:41:27,646
[gentle music]

1386
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:45,430
[machine beeping]

1387
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:53,974
1,679.

1388
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:58,243
[dramatic music]

1389
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:09,488
Can you decode on that?

1390
01:42:10,658 --> 01:42:11,658
Silly question.

1391
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:19,899
Do you have a copy of
the original Arecibo message?

1392
01:42:20,835 --> 01:42:22,502
Again, silly question.

1393
01:42:23,872 --> 01:42:26,738
The Arecibo is
a simple binary code,

1394
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,542
when arranged correctly,
it reveals...

1395
01:42:33,381 --> 01:42:34,381
this.

1396
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:36,037
This is what
the original looked like.

1397
01:42:36,137 --> 01:42:38,734
It's a visual message
containing basic information

1398
01:42:38,835 --> 01:42:40,720
about humans
and life on our planet.

1399
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:45,190
Earth biochemicals, the formula
for DNA, that sort of thing.

1400
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:49,328
If I remember correctly,
it's 73 columns wide

1401
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,898
with 21 digits in each.

1402
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:54,150
Arrange the incoming
signal like that,

1403
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,501
let's see what we get.

1404
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:03,376
[dramatic music]

1405
01:43:10,451 --> 01:43:11,817
I don't believe this.

1406
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,819
It's Arecibo all right.

1407
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:18,858
See, the base-10's is exactly the
same as the original. We've got

1408
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:21,878
carbon-based biochemistry,

1409
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:24,314
DNA nucleotides,
the double-helix,

1410
01:43:24,413 --> 01:43:25,664
it's all there.

1411
01:43:35,275 --> 01:43:36,641
Wait...

1412
01:43:38,313 --> 01:43:39,545
There are differences here.

1413
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,082
Where?

1414
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:43,466
Look.

1415
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:45,850
Subtle but significant.

1416
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:55,828
Why is it doing that?

1417
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:05,671
It's not Arecibo.

1418
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:09,960
It's a response to Arecibo.

1419
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:12,444
[dramatic music intensifies]

1420
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,284
It's almost identical.

1421
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:21,854
Meaning?

1422
01:44:27,996 --> 01:44:30,662
Meaning we're
of common cosmic origin.

1423
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:44,711
My God.

1424
01:44:52,386 --> 01:44:53,953
[machine beeping]

1425
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:56,555
No.

1426
01:44:58,059 --> 01:44:59,775
No, no, no, I'm losing power.

1427
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:02,311
- What?
- Look, my batteries are dying here.

1428
01:45:02,412 --> 01:45:05,087
Jesus, Roy, I thought you designed
these things to last all night?

1429
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:07,185
For two systems, Harry.
We're running three here,

1430
01:45:07,286 --> 01:45:08,684
plus your scope
and these aerials.

1431
01:45:08,783 --> 01:45:10,301
If we lose power,
we lose everything.

1432
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,716
- What do you mean, we lose everything?
- The recordings.

1433
01:45:12,817 --> 01:45:15,252
My hard drive's fried, remember.
We got no long-term memory.

1434
01:45:15,877 --> 01:45:17,076
[Roy] Christ.

1435
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:21,510
Look, my system can only
hold data while it's running.

1436
01:45:21,609 --> 01:45:22,609
Use my drive.

1437
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:25,402
This transfer is going
to take time and guzzle power.

1438
01:45:25,502 --> 01:45:27,859
If we can't get the files across
before I lose that power,

1439
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:28,958
then the system will die.

1440
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:32,576
- We'll lose the recordings.
- Jesus.

1441
01:45:32,676 --> 01:45:34,992
Roy, pull the plugs on everything
you've got in the back.

1442
01:45:35,091 --> 01:45:36,091
Got it.

1443
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:44,837
Come on, come on, come on.

1444
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:46,738
Roy, pull it.

1445
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:55,002
Look, we've got 18 minutes,
that's not going to be enough.

1446
01:45:55,103 --> 01:45:56,381
Do you have any spare batteries?

1447
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,318
I don't know, do we?
You guys packed the car.

1448
01:45:58,417 --> 01:46:00,533
- I didn't pack 'em.
- You mean you packed all this,

1449
01:46:00,634 --> 01:46:02,511
and didn't think
to bring some more batteries?

1450
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,247
Harry, we've got
a serious problem here.

1451
01:46:04,347 --> 01:46:05,546
We've got more than a problem.

1452
01:46:05,645 --> 01:46:06,923
What do you want me to do, Mike?

1453
01:46:07,024 --> 01:46:08,181
We've got no spare batteries.

1454
01:46:08,282 --> 01:46:09,282
[dramatic music]

1455
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:13,783
What do you want to do, Mike?

1456
01:46:13,884 --> 01:46:16,320
Well, listen, I've got some
power units back at the station.

1457
01:46:16,421 --> 01:46:17,978
- We got to go.
- We'll never make it.

1458
01:46:18,078 --> 01:46:19,238
Look, we don't have a choice.

1459
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,238
We might be the only
ones getting this data,

1460
01:46:21,337 --> 01:46:22,975
and if we want to save
these recordings,

1461
01:46:23,074 --> 01:46:24,074
we got to do something.

1462
01:46:24,173 --> 01:46:25,173
We've got 18 minutes.

1463
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:27,530
If we're going to go,
we've got to go right now.

1464
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,914
- Mike, we'll never make it.
- We can make it.

1465
01:46:31,519 --> 01:46:32,685
I'll get you there.

1466
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,122
Tell me what to do.

1467
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:41,827
Okay, okay, let's do it.

1468
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:44,396
We'll get the gear,
you cut loose what you can.

1469
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:45,881
Wait, Harry!

1470
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:47,818
What if there's more to come?

1471
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:49,720
If I pull the transmission,
we'll miss it.

1472
01:46:49,819 --> 01:46:51,520
Look, we've got
to kill it anyway.

1473
01:46:51,621 --> 01:46:53,738
We can't move the vehicle
with the aerials deployed.

1474
01:46:53,837 --> 01:46:56,034
It's better to save what
you've got than lose the lot.

1475
01:47:03,518 --> 01:47:05,101
I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

1476
01:47:05,202 --> 01:47:06,918
[dramatic music]

1477
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:14,460
[tense music]

1478
01:47:19,667 --> 01:47:21,551
Roy, grab the aerials,
I've got the scope.

1479
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:22,902
I'm on it.

1480
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,600
Come on, come on.

1481
01:47:36,699 --> 01:47:40,604
- How we looking?
- Transfer's going,
but it is drinking power, okay?

1482
01:47:40,703 --> 01:47:42,939
- we don't have much time.
- This is going to be tight.

1483
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:44,523
[Mike] Be as quick
as you can, Roy!

1484
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:47,682
Harry, get your gear loaded,
and get the car started.

1485
01:47:47,783 --> 01:47:49,060
I'm on it.

1486
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,408
Come on, come on, get
that thing in here.

1487
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:53,908
Hang on, I need
to get the tripod.

1488
01:47:54,668 --> 01:47:56,185
Bloody tripod.

1489
01:47:56,286 --> 01:47:57,770
[dramatic music]

1490
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:26,867
Key.

1491
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:29,034
Mike, where's the key?

1492
01:48:29,134 --> 01:48:30,134
I don't have it,

1493
01:48:30,233 --> 01:48:31,737
why would I have it?

1494
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:34,239
Where's the key?

1495
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:45,551
Where the hell is Roy?

1496
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:48,904
Harry, get this car started.

1497
01:48:49,005 --> 01:48:50,539
Key, give me the key!

1498
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:51,856
Damn it.

1499
01:48:54,161 --> 01:48:55,917
Mike, get this gear
loaded and ready to go.

1500
01:48:56,018 --> 01:48:57,018
Yeah.

1501
01:49:03,136 --> 01:49:04,770
[engine stuttering]

1502
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:07,157
No, no, no, no, no.

1503
01:49:07,256 --> 01:49:08,740
Come on, come on.

1504
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:18,617
Come on.

1505
01:49:19,654 --> 01:49:20,654
Come on!

1506
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:24,155
Eight percent.

1507
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:29,895
Come on, come on, hurry.

1508
01:49:29,994 --> 01:49:31,393
[Roy] Harry,
get this car started!

1509
01:49:31,493 --> 01:49:33,090
- It won't start!
- We got to go, guys.

1510
01:49:33,189 --> 01:49:34,189
Let me try.

1511
01:49:38,672 --> 01:49:40,104
- Come on.
- [engine stuttering]

1512
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:49,981
Come on, Roy. Come on, Roy.

1513
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:51,951
Come on.

1514
01:49:54,889 --> 01:49:56,055
Come on.

1515
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:59,609
Come on, get it started, Roy.

1516
01:49:59,708 --> 01:50:00,859
Come on, start.

1517
01:50:03,064 --> 01:50:04,128
Come on.

[all laughing]

1520
01:50:10,686 --> 01:50:11,686
Well done.

1521
01:50:11,786 --> 01:50:12,938
Mike, get in!

1522
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:14,608
It won't fit.

1523
01:50:14,707 --> 01:50:17,560
I can't get
the scope to fit, Harry.

1524
01:50:17,661 --> 01:50:19,457
She'll fit, Mike.
You're not doing it right.

1525
01:50:19,557 --> 01:50:20,863
- Leave it.
- What?

1526
01:50:20,963 --> 01:50:22,198
We're running out of time.

1527
01:50:22,297 --> 01:50:25,801
- No, she'll fit.
- Harry there's no
time for this, come on.

1528
01:50:25,902 --> 01:50:28,338
- Get back in the car.
- She'll fit, she'll fit, she'll fit.

1529
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:29,439
This is ridiculous.

1530
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:33,158
I'm sorry, Harry.
She's not going to fit.

1531
01:50:34,362 --> 01:50:36,112
Come on, Annabelle,
get in the car.

1532
01:50:36,212 --> 01:50:38,170
Harry, get back in the car,
we've got to go now.

1533
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:40,188
Come on, we've got 12 minutes,
we've got to go.

1534
01:50:40,287 --> 01:50:41,350
Just exactly how it was.

1535
01:50:41,451 --> 01:50:43,606
- We haven't got time for this.
- What are you doing,

1536
01:50:43,707 --> 01:50:46,155
- just get in the car.
- Just over here.

1537
01:50:46,256 --> 01:50:47,256
Harry!

1538
01:50:48,309 --> 01:50:49,742
You've got to leave her.

1539
01:50:51,412 --> 01:50:52,412
We got to go.

[soft tense music]

1542
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,711
What's he doing, Roy?
We need to go.

1543
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,127
Harry, if you don't come now,
I'm going to leave you here

1544
01:51:10,226 --> 01:51:12,146
in this field, all on
your own, with Annabelle.

01:51:14,702 --> 01:51:16,835
It's just a telescope,
I'll get you another one.

Put your foot down, Roy.

1550
01:51:29,146 --> 01:51:30,146
Let's go.

1551
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:33,886
- [engine revs]
- [dramatic music]

1552
01:51:42,729 --> 01:51:43,895
Bloody hell.

1553
01:51:52,206 --> 01:51:53,206
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Roy.

1554
01:51:53,305 --> 01:51:55,958
- You just missed a turning.
- I'm not going that way.

1555
01:51:56,059 --> 01:51:58,015
- We've got to go back.
- No, I know a shortcut.

1556
01:51:58,115 --> 01:51:59,792
It's the only way

<i>Arecibo?</i>

I need that power unit.

that decoded

the initial beacon signal,

All our tracking stations are
broadcasting the same thing.

1732
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:21,826
What does it say?

1733
02:03:23,697 --> 02:03:25,095
What else is there to say?

1734
02:03:27,934 --> 02:03:29,801
"Welcome to Earth."

Come on, come on, come on.

[uplifting music]

1742
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:20,704
I never thought...

1743
02:06:22,042 --> 02:06:24,141
No one ever thought
they'd see this.

1744
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:28,596
The world's going to wake up
in a few hours' time

1745
02:06:28,697 --> 02:06:30,368
and it's never going
to be the same.
